What is source code?
- Source code is code us(the user) create.


What makes computers so “smart”, anyway?
- Computers are "smart" in the sense that they can computer things way faster and decode our code into a language it can understand.


What is the purpose of a programming language?
- The purpose of a programming language is to convert our source code into code that the computer understands and redisplays.


What are 3 examples of programming languages? Why are there so many of these?
- 3 examples of programming languages are JavaScript, Python, and Java. There are different types of programming languages because there are many different problems that require different tools to solve them.


What is a variable? Why are variables useful?
- A variable is a letter or phrase that we can assign and store information to be referenced and manipulated.


What is the difference between a single-equals (=) and a double-equals (==)?
- A single-equal represents assignment and double-equals represents comparison.


What is the difference between a double-equals (==) and a triple-equals (===)?
- double-equals does type coercion and triple-equals does not perform type coercion.


Why does the developer console exist?
- A developer console exists so we can log information about the backend operations that will help us troubleshoot and solve issues.


When we talk about “conditional” statements, what does that mean? What is an example?
- A conditional statement is a statement we put before a block of code to know whether or not to run that code. An example would be a simple if/else statement.


Why would we want FOR or WHILE loops in our source code?
- We want to use loops for repetitive work or when we need to run the same function multiple times.


When would you use a WHILE loop, instead of a FOR loop?
- A while loop is better than a for loop when asking for user input.


What is a function? Why would we use functions?
- A function is a block of code that is reusable and performs a certain task.


How many values can you receive back from a function? How many values can you send in?
- A function can only return one object and you can send in as many parameters as you want but the more you include the slower the function will run.


What is an array? How many values does it hold?

What is a T-diagram and why should I know how to use one?
- A T-diagram is a chart we can use while going through our code so we can follow along with variable assignment and visualize what is happening.


What are the two ways to comment JS code? When would you use one versus the other?
- "//" for quick comments and "/*...*/" for large format comments.
