What is the index of the first element in an array?
- The index of the first element is 0


What is the index of the last element in an array?
- The index of the last element is arr[arr.length] or 1 minus the number of elements.


If you control an array, what is the easiest way to determine the number of values?
- You can run a for loop that increases a variable by 1 or you can use a built in function such as console.log(arr.length)


When would the above method not work well, and what must you do in that case?
- It would not work well in lower level languages or when built in functions aren't working.


What are two ways to make an array one element longer?
- Two ways to make an array one element longer is to run a for loop with an extra step or use the function push to add an element.


What are two ways to make an array two elements shorter?
- You can run a for loop and set the end of the for loop 2 numbers lower than the length or you can use the pop function twice.


What is the upper limit on the number of values an array can hold?
- It depends on the language but Javascript is 4,294,967,295 elements and Python is 536,870,912 elements.


When working with arrays, does working “in-place” really matter? If so, when and why?
- I think working in-place can be helpful in some situations where you don't want to create a temp variable.


Which values are “falsy” in JavaScript, and what does “falsy” mean anyway?
- Falsy values in Javascript are undefined, null, NaN, 0, ""(empty string), and false. A falsy means when encountered by a boolean context it will return false.

- Passing by reference means that the memory address of the variable (a pointer to the memory location) is passed to the function.
