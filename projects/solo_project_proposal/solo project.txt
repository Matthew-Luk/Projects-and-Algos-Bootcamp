Description: For my solo project I am trying to create a fake flower shop for my Aunty because she loves propagating and has a lot of plants at her house and one day my little cousin, her, and myself were sitting around drinking and we were joking about creating a flower shop for her just as a joke but this will give me the opportunity to actually make it and have fun with it

 

Stack: Python

 

Feature List:

·   Login and registration page will have validations.

	o   First and last name will have a character minimum.

	o   Email will use regex and cannot be in DB.

	o   Passwords will need to match.

·   Dashboard will have pictures and links to flower/plant types.

	o   Links to the flowers may not have any content for now because I am not seeing my aunt for a while so I don’t know when I will be able to get more pictures or I will just link them to some google images or redirect to a real flower shop that sells these items.

	o   Pictures will be of random flowers and plants.

·   Dashboard will have a navbar.

	o   Navbar will consist of:

		§  Reviews tab.

		·   “Customers” will be able to leave reviews and delete or update their review if the review being edited/deleted was created by the user logged in.

		·   Clicking on the edit button will redirect to another page where the user will be able to change their review.

		§  Home tab (if not on home page or I might just put all 4 tabs on every page except the dashboard page so we can navigate to any part of the app).

		·   Redirects user to the dashboard.

		§  Edit profile tab.

		·   User will be able to edit personal information such as first name, last name and email.

		§  Sign out tab.
